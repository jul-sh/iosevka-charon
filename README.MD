# Iosevka Julsh Font

This repository contains custom builds of the Iosevka font, tailored for personal use. It includes two variants:

1. Iosevka Julsh: A quasi-proportional sans-serif font
2. Iosevka Julsh Mono: A monospaced variant for coding.
3. Iosevka Julsh Prose: A quasi-proportional sans-serif font with a more minimalist design.

The fonts are built and released automatically for each commit.
