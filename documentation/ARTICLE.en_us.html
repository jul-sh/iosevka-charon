    Iosevka Charon is a custom cut of the Iosevka superfamily tuned for coding and terminal work.
    The quasi-proportional main family keeps dense alignment while adding gentle curves and a
    wider palette of distinction for lookalike glyphs.
</p>
<p>
    The companion Iosevka Charon Mono preserves the same stylistic decisions in a strict monospaced
    grid for tools that expect fixed-width metrics. Both families are generated from private build
    plans on top of the upstream Iosevka sources and are post-processed to meet Google Fonts QA
    expectations.
