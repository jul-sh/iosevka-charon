    Iosevka Charon is a custom cut of the Iosevka superfamily tuned for coding and terminal work.
    The quasi-proportional main family is excellent for technical writing and dense UI while
    keeping alignment tight enough for editors.
</p>
<p>
    The companion Iosevka Charon Mono preserves the same stylistic decisions in a strict monospaced
    grid that excels for coding and terminal use. Both families are generated from private build
    plans on top of the upstream Iosevka sources and are post-processed to meet Google Fonts QA
    expectations.
