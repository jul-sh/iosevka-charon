<p><strong>Iosevka Charon</strong> is a tailored build of the Iosevka typeface for code, shells, and dense UI surfaces. It keeps the signature narrow rhythm, adds clearer glyph differentiation, and balances curves with hard edges for high legibility at small sizes.</p>
<p>The family ships in two flavors: a quasi-proportional set optimized for technical writing and UI layouts, and a strict monospaced companion under the name <strong>Iosevka Charon Mono</strong> that stays true to fixed-width grids for coding and terminal use. Both are generated from custom private build plans and post-processed to align with Google Fonts quality requirements.</p>
