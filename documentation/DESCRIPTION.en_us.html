<p><strong>Iosevka Charon</strong> is a tailored build of the Iosevka typeface for code, shells, and dense UI surfaces. It keeps the signature narrow rhythm, adds clearer glyph differentiation, and balances curves with hard edges for high legibility at small sizes.</p>
<p>The family ships in two flavors: a quasi-proportional set for editors that can benefit from subtle width variation, and a strict monospaced companion under the name <strong>Iosevka Charon Mono</strong>. Both are generated from custom private build plans and post-processed to align with Google Fonts quality requirements.</p>
